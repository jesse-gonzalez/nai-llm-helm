NUTANIX CLOUD CLUSTERS  (NC2)
OVERVIEW
Nutanix Cloud Clusters  (NC2) delivers a hybrid multicloud platform designed to run applications in private or
multiple public clouds. NC2 operates as an extension of on-prem datacenters and provides a hybrid cloud architecture
that spans private and public clouds, operated as a single cloud.
NC2 extends the simplicity and ease of use of the Nutanix software stack to public clouds using a unified
management console. Using the same platform on both clouds, NC2 on AWS  reduces the operational complexity of
extending, bursting, or migrating your applications and data between clouds. NC2 runs AOS and AHV on the public
cloud instances and packages the same CLI, GUI, and APIs that cloud operators use in their on-prem environments.
NC2 resources, including bare-metal hosts, are deployed in your AWS account so that you can leverage your existing
cloud provider relationships, credits, commits, and discounts. Nutanix provisions the full bare-metal host for your use,
and the bare-metal hosts are not shared by multiple customers. Every customer that deploys NC2 will be provisioning
bare-metal hosts independent of other customers’ bare-metal hosts. The bare-metal hosts are not shared by multiple
tenants.
Figure 1: Overview of the Nutanix Hybrid Multicloud Platform
NC2 on AWS  place the complete Nutanix hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) stack directly on a bare-metal
instance in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This bare-metal instance runs a Controller VM (CVM) and
Nutanix AHV as the hypervisor like any on-premises Nutanix deployment, using the AWS Elastic Network Interface
(ENI) to connect to the network. AHV user VMs do not require any additional configuration to access AWS services
or other EC2 instances.

Move Architecture
Move is a distributed application which supports mobility from multiple sources such as ESXi, Hyper-V,
AWS, Azure, and AHV.
Figure 1: Distributed Architecture of Move
Components of Move
The preceding diagram depicts the distributed architecture of Move which has the following components.
•Nutanix Move : VM, which orchestrates the migration and can be accessed using the Move CLI or
Move UI.
•Move Agent  (only for Hyper-V migrations): A Move agent service is deployed on the Hyper-V host. This
Move agent communicates with the Source Agent and interfaces with the source VMs on the Hyper-V
host to facilitate the migration.
Note :  Move 3.7.1 and later versions support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. If any operating system does not support
TLS 1.1 and above, update the operating system with an appropriate patch before the migration or perform
data only migrations for such VMs.
Move Components in various Migration Paths
The Move components are used in the following ways during various types of migration:
•VMware ESXi to Nutanix AHV
When you are moving VMs from ESXi to AHV, Nutanix Move directly communicates with vCenter
(vCenter is the management interface for the VMs running on the ESXi hypervisor) through the
Management Server and the Source Agent. VMware Tools should be installed on the source VMs. The
Source Agent collects information from the VMware library about the VMs being migrated.
•VMware ESXi on legacy infrastructure to VMware ESXi on Nutanix
When you are moving VMs from VMware ESXi on legacy infrastructure to VMware ESXi on Nutanix,
Nutanix Move directly communicates with Prism (management interface for the VMs running on AOS)
through the Management Server and the Source Agent.
Move  |  Move Overview  | 9

AHV runs an embedded distributed network controller that integrates user VM networking with AWS networking.
Instead of creating an overlay network, NC2 on AWS  integrates IP address management with AWS Virtual Private
Cloud (VPC). AWS allocates all user VM IP addresses from the AWS subnets in the existing VPCs. Native
integration with AWS networking allows you to seamlessly use AWS services on AHV user VMs without a complex
network deployment or performance loss.
AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches and ensures that application availability and performance
are managed as per the configured resilience. Combining features such as native rack awareness with AWS partition
placement groups allows Nutanix to operate freely in a dynamic cloud environment.
In addition to the traditional resilience solutions for Prism Central, NC2 on AWS  also provides the Cluster Protect
feature that helps to protect Prism Central. UVM, and volume groups data in case of full cluster failures caused by
scenarios, such as Availability Zones (AZs) failures or users shutting down all nodes from the AWS console. For
details, see Cluster Protect Configuration .
NC2 on AWS  provides on-prem workloads, a home in the cloud, offering native access to available AWS services
without requiring you to reconfigure your software.
You use the NC2 console to deploy a cluster in a VPC in AWS. After you launch a Nutanix cluster in AWS by using
NC2, you can operate the cluster in the same manner as you operate your on-prem Nutanix cluster with no change in
nCLI, the Prism Element and Prism Central web console, and APIs. You use the NC2 console to create, hibernate,
resume, update, and delete your Nutanix cluster.

•Runs on the EC2 bare-metal instances. For more information on the supported EC2 bare-metal instances, see
Supported Regions and Bare-metal Instances .

Figure 7: NC2 on AWS  Architecture
This enables our MapReduce Framework (Curator) to use the full power of the cluster to perform activities
concurrently. For example, activities such as data reprotection, compression, erasure coding, deduplication, and more.
Figure 8: Cluster Deployment in a VPC
 Preventing Network Partition Errors
AOS Storage  uses the Paxos algorithm to avoid split-brain scenarios. Paxos is a proven protocol for reaching
consensus or quorum among several participants in a distributed system.
Before any file system metadata is written to Cassandra, Paxos ensures that all nodes in the system agree on the
value. If the nodes do not reach a quorum, the operation fails in order to prevent any potential corruption or data
inconsistency. This design protects against events such as network partitioning, where communication between nodes
may fail or packets may become corrupt, leading to a scenario where nodes disagree on values. AOS Storage  also
uses time stamps to ensure that updates are applied in the proper order.
 Resolving Bad Disk Resources
AOS Storage  incorporates a Curator process that performs background housekeeping tasks to keep the entire cluster
running smoothly.

NUTANIX CLOUD CLUSTERS  (NC2)
OVERVIEW
Nutanix Cloud Clusters  (NC2) delivers a hybrid multicloud platform designed to run applications in private or
multiple public clouds. NC2 operates as an extension of on-prem datacenters and provides a hybrid cloud architecture
that spans private and public clouds, operated as a single cloud.
NC2 extends the simplicity and ease of use of the Nutanix software stack to public clouds using a unified
management console. Using the same platform on both clouds, NC2 on AWS  reduces the operational complexity of
extending, bursting, or migrating your applications and data between clouds. NC2 runs AOS and AHV on the public
cloud instances and packages the same CLI, GUI, and APIs that cloud operators use in their on-prem environments.
NC2 resources, including bare-metal hosts, are deployed in your AWS account so that you can leverage your existing
cloud provider relationships, credits, commits, and discounts. Nutanix provisions the full bare-metal host for your use,
and the bare-metal hosts are not shared by multiple customers. Every customer that deploys NC2 will be provisioning
bare-metal hosts independent of other customers’ bare-metal hosts. The bare-metal hosts are not shared by multiple
tenants.
Figure 1: Overview of the Nutanix Hybrid Multicloud Platform
NC2 on AWS  place the complete Nutanix hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) stack directly on a bare-metal
instance in Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2). This bare-metal instance runs a Controller VM (CVM) and
Nutanix AHV as the hypervisor like any on-premises Nutanix deployment, using the AWS Elastic Network Interface
(ENI) to connect to the network. AHV user VMs do not require any additional configuration to access AWS services
or other EC2 instances.

Move Architecture
Move is a distributed application which supports mobility from multiple sources such as ESXi, Hyper-V,
AWS, Azure, and AHV.
Figure 1: Distributed Architecture of Move
Components of Move
The preceding diagram depicts the distributed architecture of Move which has the following components.
•Nutanix Move : VM, which orchestrates the migration and can be accessed using the Move CLI or
Move UI.
•Move Agent  (only for Hyper-V migrations): A Move agent service is deployed on the Hyper-V host. This
Move agent communicates with the Source Agent and interfaces with the source VMs on the Hyper-V
host to facilitate the migration.
Note :  Move 3.7.1 and later versions support TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. If any operating system does not support
TLS 1.1 and above, update the operating system with an appropriate patch before the migration or perform
data only migrations for such VMs.
Move Components in various Migration Paths
The Move components are used in the following ways during various types of migration:
•VMware ESXi to Nutanix AHV
When you are moving VMs from ESXi to AHV, Nutanix Move directly communicates with vCenter
(vCenter is the management interface for the VMs running on the ESXi hypervisor) through the
Management Server and the Source Agent. VMware Tools should be installed on the source VMs. The
Source Agent collects information from the VMware library about the VMs being migrated.
•VMware ESXi on legacy infrastructure to VMware ESXi on Nutanix
When you are moving VMs from VMware ESXi on legacy infrastructure to VMware ESXi on Nutanix,
Nutanix Move directly communicates with Prism (management interface for the VMs running on AOS)
through the Management Server and the Source Agent.
Move  |  Move Overview  | 9

AHV runs an embedded distributed network controller that integrates user VM networking with AWS networking.
Instead of creating an overlay network, NC2 on AWS  integrates IP address management with AWS Virtual Private
Cloud (VPC). AWS allocates all user VM IP addresses from the AWS subnets in the existing VPCs. Native
integration with AWS networking allows you to seamlessly use AWS services on AHV user VMs without a complex
network deployment or performance loss.
AOS can withstand hardware failures and software glitches and ensures that application availability and performance
are managed as per the configured resilience. Combining features such as native rack awareness with AWS partition
placement groups allows Nutanix to operate freely in a dynamic cloud environment.
In addition to the traditional resilience solutions for Prism Central, NC2 on AWS  also provides the Cluster Protect
feature that helps to protect Prism Central. UVM, and volume groups data in case of full cluster failures caused by
scenarios, such as Availability Zones (AZs) failures or users shutting down all nodes from the AWS console. For
details, see Cluster Protect Configuration .
NC2 on AWS  provides on-prem workloads, a home in the cloud, offering native access to available AWS services
without requiring you to reconfigure your software.
You use the NC2 console to deploy a cluster in a VPC in AWS. After you launch a Nutanix cluster in AWS by using
NC2, you can operate the cluster in the same manner as you operate your on-prem Nutanix cluster with no change in
nCLI, the Prism Element and Prism Central web console, and APIs. You use the NC2 console to create, hibernate,
resume, update, and delete your Nutanix cluster.

•Runs on the EC2 bare-metal instances. For more information on the supported EC2 bare-metal instances, see
Supported Regions and Bare-metal Instances .

Figure 7: NC2 on AWS  Architecture
This enables our MapReduce Framework (Curator) to use the full power of the cluster to perform activities
concurrently. For example, activities such as data reprotection, compression, erasure coding, deduplication, and more.
Figure 8: Cluster Deployment in a VPC
 Preventing Network Partition Errors
AOS Storage  uses the Paxos algorithm to avoid split-brain scenarios. Paxos is a proven protocol for reaching
consensus or quorum among several participants in a distributed system.
Before any file system metadata is written to Cassandra, Paxos ensures that all nodes in the system agree on the
value. If the nodes do not reach a quorum, the operation fails in order to prevent any potential corruption or data
inconsistency. This design protects against events such as network partitioning, where communication between nodes
may fail or packets may become corrupt, leading to a scenario where nodes disagree on values. AOS Storage  also
uses time stamps to ensure that updates are applied in the proper order.
 Resolving Bad Disk Resources
AOS Storage  incorporates a Curator process that performs background housekeeping tasks to keep the entire cluster
running smoothly.

Nutanix is about customer choice, customers can run their preferred distribution\n\nUsers can access the NKE console and perform certain tasks based on the assigned role.A member of the User Admin role in PC has full access to NKE and its functionalities.A member of the Cluster Admin role or Viewer role can only download kubeconfig.An NKE-enabled Kubernetes cluster out-of-the-box uses Prism Central for authentication and maps the PC role User Admin with the\n\nNutanix HCI clusters.                          NKE Architecture NKE runs as a containerized service in Prism Central. When Kubernetes Management is enabled on a PC, two containers are provisioned under the covers: the karbon-core container and the karbon-ui container.Karbon-core is responsible for the lifecycle of Kubernetes clusters. Tasks such as provisioning, node OS upgrades,\n\nNKE instance. On the other hand, the PC roles Cluster Admin and Viewer do not have a mapping with a Kubernetes role. This means that a user member of any of these two roles can download the kubeconfig from NKE, but not perform any action at the Kubernetes level. A super-admin user will have to create the correct role mapping inside Kubernetes.                          Pro tip\n\nQuestion: What is NKE\nHelpful Answer: NKE stands for Nutanix Kubernetes Engine. It is a platform within the Nutanix Cloud Platform that enables users to easily manage and deploy containerized workloads using Kubernetes."]}]}
